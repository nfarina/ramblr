# Ramblr

Are you spending time composing your thoughts, then typing them carefully into the "prompt" box for an AI like ChatGPT, Cursor, or Claude Code?

Stop that!

AI doesn't need your thoughts and instructions all nicely written out like this README is for humans. Rambling is better! Here's an example:

<img width="512" height="512" alt="Rambl ramble" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44f9a7ab-34c2-4780-9c58-747dd1e37afb"/>

Wow, that's a lot of text to read - but AI is *great* at reading lots of text like this, and this text is _full_ of useful information. Rambles better represent your true state of mind: you might repeat yourself if you're sure about something, or waffle when you're not. That's all signal.

The best way to ramble is to hit Start Listening before you even begin reviewing an AI's response. Then just blab your thoughts while you're looking over its work, and when you're done reviewing, hit Stop. Ramblr will transcribe your blatherings using OpenAI's Whisper API with astonishing accuracy, then put the result in your clipboard and beep a notification when it's ready to be pasted somewhere.

Ramblr is a native macOS app that lives in your menubar. All you need to do is download the app and paste your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## Features

- Global hotkey (⌥D) to start/stop recording
- Near-perfect transcription via OpenAI Whisper API
- Copies to clipboard and notifies with sound when ready to paste
- History of the last 10 transcriptions for quick re-copy

## Wait, doesn't this already exist?

[Yes](https://superwhisper.com), [yes](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper), [yes](https://wisprflow.ai). But I have problems with them all:

- They all want to lock you into a subscription model. For dictation!
- They either use a local transcription model (not as accurate, or slower) or the Whisper API (that's the real magic here)

I just wanted something I could use at cost. So I vibe-coded Ramblr. It's free to download and use! You just pay OpenAI directly for the Whisper API, which is pennies.
